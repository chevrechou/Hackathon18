# Hackathon18
Team 61

  Music is an essential part of the human experience. As Nietzsche once stated: “Without music, life would be a mistake.” Team 61, as we proudly name ourselves, understands the importance of music and the way it can affect one’s mood. During this hackathon, we came up with a unique program to help individuals express themselves.

  As two first time hackathon participants, my partner and I created a simple program, called Tone-2-MP3,  that plays a song depending on the user’s mood. 

  Users can talk into a microphone and the program, using IBM Watson Speech to text API, can transcribe their speech. Then, IBM Watson Tone Analyzer can analyze the text and pick up the mood of the user. Finally, according to their mood, a song will be played. For example, a happy user will say something such as : “I had a great day”. Our program will start playing a happy song, such as “Happy” by Pharrell Williams . If the user is sad, they might say something such as “I am sad”, and the program will start playing “Sad” by Maroon 5.

  We believe that this simple, yet useful program, can truly help users better express their emotions.
